### Intro

This is an example of an ETL system in TypeScript. The remote data is a binary file with fixed-width records, and the expected output is a CSV file with records adhering to a common, locally defined schema.

### Getting Started

With node and yarn installed, run `yarn` then `yarn start` to run the script. The script will output the data to `output.csv`. All code is located in `src/index.ts`.
